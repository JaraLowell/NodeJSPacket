# NodeJSPacket
NodeJS Ham Radio Packet

Build in Node JS

Right now it sends and recieves, can connect but has still some ways to go; The map data it grabs from the monitor if a station in it's beacon sends it's location.

It also only right now coded to work with the WA8DED protocol as some tnc's use so not KISS as if yet tough perhaps atr a stage this be a good thing to add or via
a driver file of sorts. I'm in end just a hoby coder so am sure it not the best of the best and many other selutions be posible vs what i done. So who knows
with a few more people we can make this a great add on packat software for the ham world.

Mine is running on a Raspberry PI, and then any computer in my house can access it via a web site as seen in the images below.
